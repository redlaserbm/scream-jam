### MOTIVATION ###

At its core, the role of the textbox is just to display dialogue for characters.
"Kala was Killed" uses a system built off of a framework provided by Peyton
Burnham. The first part of that tutorial is listed here:

### TEXT STORAGE --- BASICS ###

Text is stored in "dictionaries", which associate certain strings with conversations.
For example, in the dictionary "foo", the string "cookie" may represent a
convseration about cookies.

The dictionary itself is a switch, with cases corresponding to the strings. Within
each case lies a list of scr_text(...) commands, which essentially prescribe how
the conservation is intended to go.

### TEXT STORAGE --- BRANCHING DIALOGUE ###

The above system is only good for capturing basic dialogue. To expand it, we introduce
scr_option(...) for handling multiple dialogue options. To accomodate for branching
dialogue, use scr_option(...) for each branching choice at the end of the entry.

### BASICS ###

The framework for the textbox is not limited to just obj_textbox. 
In fact, there's also a system of scripts to handle textbox functionality as needed.
All such scripts are contained in Scripts/Textbox. The core scripts are as such:

- scr_text(...) tells the textbox at a given page number what information it needs
to display 
- scr_textbox_create(...) generates a textbox based on an id and a dictionary
- 

### TEXT STORAGE --- END ACTIONS ###

In general, we may need the game to trigger arbitrary actions after a conversation
is finished. For example, completing one conversation may trigger getting a new item.
Completing another may take you to another location. Scripts/Textbox/scr_end_actions
contains a list of functions that textbox items could run after they are finished.
Certain conversations can amend functions to an array end_actions which runs when
the textbox is to be destroyed.

### CODE OPTIMIZATION --- TECH DEBT ###

The textbox code can benefit from optimization for readibility before inclusion into
this project. It works but isn't exactly super legible...
