Typically, games in GameMaker have a "controller" object (which we 
have adopted the convention of calling obj_game) that is persistent and tracks
important game info as it evolves over time.

For the purpose of separation of functionality, we actually have *multiple* such controller objects:
- obj_game (tracks state variables)
- obj_logger (tracks history of conversations)
- obj_music (determines the music to play at any given point)

Typically, obj_music will receive signals from other objects whenever the music needs to change.
