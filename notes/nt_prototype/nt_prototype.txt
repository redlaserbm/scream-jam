For now, our goal is to create the prototype scenario below. There are three bullet
points of focus, and I've ordered them in terms of importance.

1. There are two locations, which the player can travel freely between by accessing the map.
The map can be accessed whenever the player is not actively engaging in a conversation.

2. The player can view a log of text from past conversations. 

3. The player has access to an inventory, which contains items of interest that the player can
examine for more details if desired.

Items 2 and 3 were implemented to a significant degree in "Kala was Killed". Item 2's code can
probably be copied and pasted without much trouble, but item 3 may still be cumbersome to
implement, as we want to do things slightly differently than in Kala was Killed.

To prevent scope creep, consider omitting 3 for the scream jam, but implementing it for a
later project.

### Text Conversations ###

In order to simulate conversations, we must introduce at least two characters and implement
the textbox system. For now, we can just use Laser and Temmie from "Kala was Killed" for 
testing purposes.

Notice that we don't need *objects* to represent characters, just sprites. 

### Dynamic Backgrounds & Music ###

We are going to gut current functionality
